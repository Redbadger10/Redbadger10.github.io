			<li>While I have taken a few CS classes, I have done very little web development and it was a long time ago. This is all very new territory for me and I am excited to learn a new skill!</li><br>
			<li>In this class I am hoping to learn how to develop websites that not only look nice, but are funtional and easy to use. I also want to learn how the back end of websites works!</li><br>
			<li>I have signed up for our campus wire</li><br>
			<li>One of the most interesting experiences I have had was ocean fishing in Alaska. At the time that I was in Alaska, we weren't sure we were going to be able to fish at all due to a large storm in the area, but luckily, we barely avoided it.</li><br>
