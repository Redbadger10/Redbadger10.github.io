		<h2>Assignment 1 - HTML and web publishing</h2>
		<p>Like most coding projects I have done, it is always the thing I least expect that is the most challenging. The two problems that I ran into were getting github and the engineering server to cooperate. At some point, I had messed up my ssh keys and only solved the issue after a lot of struggle  and confusion. I learned about lists in html, which is something I have not experimented with before, and I also learned how to use a terminal to interact with git and github. The resources that helped me the most were the class website and stack overflow. I found that the class website gave me all the information I should have needed for the assignment, and stack overflow supplemented the bits I messed up or were wrong with my machine.</p>

		<h2>Assignment 2 - Styling A Page With CSS</h2>
		<p>What I found most challenging about this assignment was the non rigid nature of CSS. It felt like many parts of CSS are weirdly intertwined, creating unexpected interactions between objects.<br>
			In this assignment, I learned a lot about flex boxes and how they interact with the size of the contents within them. I also learned a lot about spacing elements.<br>
			I used a wide range of forums for this assignment as well as the lecture notes from class. I used the website "css-tricks" a lot since it went into detail on how to use flex boxes.<br>
			I had to google a lot of things. Despite most of the stuff being covered in lecture, without an experience, there were a lot of things I still didn't fully understand.
