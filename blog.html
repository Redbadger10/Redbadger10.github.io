		<h2>Assignment 1 - HTML and web publishing</h2>
		<p>Like most coding projects I have done, it is always the thing I least expect that is the most challenging. The two problems that I ran into were getting github and the engineering server to cooperate. At some point, I had messed up my ssh keys and only solved the issue after a lot of struggle  and confusion. I learned about lists in html, which is something I have not experimented with before, and I also learned how to use a terminal to interact with git and github. The resources that helped me the most were the class website and stack overflow. I found that the class website gave me all the information I should have needed for the assignment, and stack overflow supplemented the bits I messed up or were wrong with my machine.</p>

		<h2>Assignment 2 - Styling A Page With CSS</h2>
		<p>What I found most challenging about this assignment was the non rigid nature of CSS. It felt like many parts of CSS are weirdly intertwined, creating unexpected interactions between objects.<br>
			In this assignment, I learned a lot about flex boxes and how they interact with the size of the contents within them. I also learned a lot about spacing elements.<br>
			I used a wide range of forums for this assignment as well as the lecture notes from class. I used the website "css-tricks" a lot since it went into detail on how to use flex boxes.<br>
			I had to google a lot of things. Despite most of the stuff being covered in lecture, without an experience, there were a lot of things I still didn't fully understand.

		<h2>Assignment 3 - Client-side JS</h2>
		<p>I think the most challenging part of this project was just determining what functions I needed to use. Compared to c++, it feels like there are a lot more built-in functions to learn.<br>
			Pretty much all of this assignment was uncharted territory for me. One thing I learned was how easy it is to inject malicious code into websites if your inputs are not properly checked.<br>
			The most useful resources were the lecture notes and the many forums on the internet. Because JS is such a popular language, there is a lot of documentation online about how to properly code in JS.<br>
			I had to google almost everything at one point. One of the more difficult things to figure out was how to use an array to store the posts when they weren't in the DOM.<br></p>
		<br>
		<h2>Assignment 4 - Native Node.js file serving</h2>
		<p>The most challenging part of this assignment for me was simply understanding where to start. I was very confused and didn't fully understand some of the basics of node.js.<br>
			There were a lot of things I learned durring this assignment. Almost every line of code that I wrote in this project was completely new to me.<br>
			The lecture notes were invaluable and the internet helped me discover things like maps and switch statements which made parts of this program a lot easier.<br>
			I had to google pretty much every node.js function that was used to better understand it. I had to google how to use the request and data elements as well as how to write things using write and writeHead.<br></p>
