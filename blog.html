		<h2>Assignment 1 - HTML and web publishing</h2>
		<p>Like most coding projects I have done, it is always the thing I least expect that is the most challenging. The two problems that I ran into were getting github and the engineering server to cooperate. At some point, I had messed up my ssh keys and only solved the issue after a lot of struggle  and confusion. I learned about lists in html, which is something I have not experimented with before, and I also learned how to use a terminal to interact with git and github. The resources that helped me the most were the class website and stack overflow. I found that the class website gave me all the information I should have needed for the assignment, and stack overflow supplemented the bits I messed up or were wrong with my machine.</p>
